## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- BEM CSS classes
- CSS Grid
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I began this project using Flexbox, however after some difficulty I switch to using a Grid layout with each card being a Flexbox element. While CSS Grid has many options I limited my code to only the necessary properties and adding to my classes via media queries. I also expanded on the original prompt by adding a tablet layout!
